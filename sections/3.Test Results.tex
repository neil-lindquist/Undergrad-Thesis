%TODO tables for days
%TODO conclusions from test results

Tables~\ref{tab:results-vec}, \ref{tab:results-val} and~\ref{tab:results-ind} show the compression results for compressing just the vector values, matrix values and matrix indices respectively.
Note that some compression strategies had multiple variations that were tested.
The compression of just one data structure fails to outperform the baseline implementation; Section~\ref{sec:results-bounds} discusses this further.

\subsection{Performance Improvement Bounds}
\label{sec:results-bounds}
Note that Table~\ref{tab:results-val} shows 1 bit compression under performing the baseline implementation, even though it has a significant compression rate.
This demonstrates that compressing the matrix values alone in unable to improve performance.
For the vector values, note that the single precision implementation has a 2.3 times increase in iterations to convergence over the baseline implementation and that the GFLOPs rating of the single precision implementation is reduced by a factor of approximately 2.19 from the baseline implementation.
This hints that, even without increasing the number of Conjugate Gradient iterations, compressing the vectors will provide a limited improvement in performance at best.
This analysis is supported by the fact that no compression strategies that only compressed a single strategy was able to out perform the baseline implementation.

\subsection{Compiler Settings Analysis}
%TODO discuss why compiler settings don't have a significant affect on things

\subsection{Testing Environment}
%TODO test setup
Timings measured with a problem of size \(96^3\) with 60 processes on the walbert cluster.
